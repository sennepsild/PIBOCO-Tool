# PIBOCO-Tool
Node editor for scenehandling, made as a PIBOCO tech challenge.

Create, drag and edit nodes to set up intricate branching stories or just make it easier to control and get an overview of which scene leads to another. 

This includes several hardcoded dummy scenes with a little alien, but is set up with game events and the tool would be flexible to any kind of scene.
