# PIBOCO-Tool
Node editor for scenehandling, made as a PIBOCO tech challenge.

Create, drag and edit nodes to set up intricate branching stories or just make it easier to control and get an overview of which scene leads to another. 

This includes several hardcoded dummy scenes with a little alien, but is set up with flexible game events and the tool would fit to any kind of scene.

This were made with Unity version 2019.2.9f1, but should work in newer versions.

Following Unity packages were added and used for the Alien animation:
2D Animation preview v2.2.1
2D IK preview v1.2.0
2D PSD Importer preview v1.2.0

The images used in the Project are in Photoshop file format and might not behave correctly if Photoshop is not installed.
